        """
        Compute a multidimensional binned statistic for a set of data.

        This is a generalization of a histogramdd function.  A
        histogram divides the space into bins, and returns the count
        of the number of points in each bin.  This function allows the
        computation of the sum, mean, median, or other statistic of
        the values within each bin.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sample : array_like
            Data to histogram passed as a sequence of D arrays of length N, or
            as an (N,D) array.
        statistic : string or callable, optional
            The statistic to compute (default is 'mean'). To compute multiple
            statistics efficiently, override this at __call__ time.
            The following statistics are available:

              * 'mean' : compute the mean of values for points within each bin.
                Empty bins will be represented by NaN.
              * 'median' : compute the median of values for points within each
                bin. Empty bins will be represented by NaN.
              * 'count' : compute the count of points within each bin.  This is
                identical to an unweighted histogram.  `values` array is not
                referenced.
              * 'sum' : compute the sum of values for points within each bin.
                This is identical to a weighted histogram.
              * function : a user-defined function which takes a 1D array of
                values, and outputs a single numerical statistic. This function
                will be called on the values in each bin.  Empty bins will be
                represented by function([]), or NaN if this returns an error.
        bins : sequence or int, optional
            The bin specification:

              * A sequence of arrays describing the bin edges along each
                dimension.
              * The number of bins for each dimension (nx, ny, ... =bins)
              * The number of bins for all dimensions (nx=ny=...=bins).
        range : sequence, optional
            A sequence of lower and upper bin edges to be used if the
            edges are not given explicitely in `bins`. Defaults to the
            minimum and maximum values along each dimension.
        mask : array_like
            array of ones and zeros with total size N (see documentation
            for `sample`). Values with mask==0 will be ignored.

        Note: If using numpy versions < 1.10.0, you may notice slow behavior of
        this constructor. This has to do with digitize, which was optimized
        from 1.10.0 onwards.

        The following statistics are available:

          * 'mean' : compute the mean of values for points within each bin.
            Empty bins will be represented by NaN.
          * 'median' : compute the median of values for points within each
            bin. Empty bins will be represented by NaN.
          * 'count' : compute the count of points within each bin.  This is
            identical to an unweighted histogram.  `values` array is not
            referenced.
          * 'sum' : compute the sum of values for points within each bin.
            This is identical to a weighted histogram.
          * function : a user-defined function which takes a 1D array of
            values, and outputs a single numerical statistic. This function
            will be called on the values in each bin.  Empty bins will be
            represented by function([]), or NaN if this returns an error.

    bins : int or [int, int] or array_like or [array, array], optional
        The bin specification:

          * the number of bins for the two dimensions (nx=ny=bins),
          * the number of bins in each dimension (nx, ny = bins),
          * the bin edges for the two dimensions (x_edges = y_edges = bins),
          * the bin edges in each dimension (x_edges, y_edges = bins).

    range : (2,2) array_like, optional
        The leftmost and rightmost edges of the bins along each dimension
        (if not specified explicitly in the `bins` parameters):
        [[xmin, xmax], [ymin, ymax]]. All values outside of this range will be
        considered outliers and not tallied in the histogram.
    mask : array_like
        ones and zeros with the same shape as `x`.
        Values with mask==0 will be ignored.
